# SQL-Employees-Database
Analyzing company ‘employees’ database to provide a summary of the database to an incoming data manager at the company who wants to know the state of the database

## Objective
The purpose of this task is to provide a summary of the database to an incoming data manager at the company who wants to know the state of the database. The information required include understanding the overall structure, volume and quality of the data. I have also decided to include insights on the employees composition within the company.

Part of the database task is to check on the quality of the data and any quality issues will be noted down. However no cleaning is intended to be done (yet) as the purpose of this task is to present the state of the database as is.


## Dataset
This dataset is an employees database, sourced from on [Github](https://github.com/datacharmer/test_db) and reorganized into an SQL script by [365 Careers](https://365careers.com/). This script contains the code that will enable you to create your database. Open the script in your SQL client and run it.

## Analysis
Data were queried using MySQL. Codes can be found under SQL Queries folder.

## Findings
Findings are documented in Tableau and additional details can be found [here](www.datadally.com/projects/employees-database-analysis).
